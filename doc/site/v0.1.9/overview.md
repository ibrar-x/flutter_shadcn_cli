# Overview (v0.1.9 Legacy)

`v0.1.9` describes the legacy command/runtime model kept for migration and compatibility history.

## Legacy Characteristics

- Primarily single-registry operations.
- Core install/remove/sync workflow without namespace directory discovery.
- Older config/state model before full multi-registry addressing.

## Migration Path

Move to [v0.2.0](../v0.2.0/overview.md) for multi-registry and inline init support.
